It is a report to analyze the standardized test results in Math and Reading in both Charter and District Schools.
In this report too, it gives various information on the student's performance on the given test.
Charter schools have unique freedom and flexibility not found in public school districts. Education often allows them to dedicate increased resources and energy on supporting students in excelling academic standards.
One of the big differences between charter schools and traditional public schools is in their flexibility. Charter schools tend to be more flexible and therefore are able to make faster progress than traditional public schools.
In my opinion the big budget alloted for district school does not guarantee academic excellence (Math and Reading) in every students. It's how to cater each student, according to their needs and capability in which Charter school doing in every enrollees. And it is what is showing in the chart.
